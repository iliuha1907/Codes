# 1. BFS Project
It is just a realization of the breadth-first search algorithm

# 2. DBandSwing project

It is a communication with Derby database and Java. It contains GUI

# 3. DLL Project

It contains 2 DLL and 1 Static Library, created by me. DemonstratorDLL is actually a GUI that provides work with DLL and 1 Static Library. ImageDll displays an image on the form, DLLShowProc displays list of processes of the computer, static library just makes a beep.
